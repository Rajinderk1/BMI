# BMI Calculator
This is a simple Python script to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input for weight and height.
## Description

The script prompts the user to enter their weight in kilograms and height in meters. It then calculates the BMI using the formula:

\[ \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{weight (kg)}}{\text{height (m)}^2} \]

Finally, it outputs the calculated BMI value.
